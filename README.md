# Personal Academic Page of Peyman Bateni
Repository for maintaining personal academic web-page! This repository directly builds on top of Jon Barron's webpage (source code can found at https://github.com/jonbarron/website). Feel free to use his or my webpage source code for your own website, and if you do so, make sure you give Jon Barron credit for the amazingly simple and elegant template!
